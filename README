---------------

create a fast executable from a scala script.

What's this?
------------

Running a .scala file as a script (e.g. scala helloworld.scala) is painfully slow -- 1-6 seconds for hello.
quickdraw is a convenience tool that will build you an executable jar and a wrapper shell script.  

All the actual heavy lifting is being done by the proguard and the sbt proguard plugin.


Installation from binary
------------------------
Download, unpack, copy quickdraw.jar and quickdraw in the same directory on your path.

Installation from sbt
---------------------

# run quickdraw on itself
sbt 'run src/main/scala/Main.scala quickdraw'

... and now move quickdraw and quickdraw.jar (created in the sbt directory) to your path.

Usage
-----

quickdraw YOURFILE.scala SCRIPTNAME

For example, put the following in helloworld.scala:

object Main {
  def main(args:Array[String) { 
    println("hello world!");
  }
}

... and then create your 'hello' :

quickdraw helloworld.scala hello

... and then run ./hello

If you want, compare the execution time:

scala helloworld.scala
./hello


TODO
----

-- finish basic implementation
-- add proper command line handling
-- right now, scripts can't have jar dependencies, so ...
  -- Support custom sbt 'template' directories so scripts can have dependencies
  -- Support the specification of a direcotry with jars to include (symlink right into template lib?)
